This data has been created using the scatnet MATLAB software;

https://github.com/scatnet/scatnet

To generate the data, we have changed the normalization in the
conv_sub_1d.m code as follows:

Line 74 changed from:
	y_ds = ifft(yf_ds)/2^(ds^2);

Line 74 changed to:
	y_ds = ifft(yf_ds)/2^(ds);

The result of this change is that the action of the periodization
is to decimate the convolution, without changing the normalization.
Statements were inserted in wavelet_1d.m, the output of which, with
the above change, are the decimated convolutions:

|x*\psi|, ||x*\psi|*\psi| etc.
